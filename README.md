### All submissions are to be done using GitHub. Submissions via email are ignored.
* Your repository should consist of the following:
* final-presentation.pptx (can be in other format)
* pom.xml Assume mvn command on the PATH environment variable. Reference: https://mkyong.com/maven/how-to-run-unit-test-with-maven
* src/main/java
This directory contains all your Java source files.
* target/classes
This directory is left empty during submission. After compile.bat runs, the class files will be stored here automatically.
* lib (Only if using any external libraries)
This directory contains any jar files that you use for your application.
* sql (for MySQL)
This directory contains the deploy.sql script, and README.txt.
* Only the use of external free or open source libraries (e.g. opencsv) is allowed. No other form of code-sharing is allowed. Co-development of code with members from other teams is a definite NO-NO.
